# A Little About Me

My name is Kayla, but my friends call me 'Kayak' (it's a long story).

I have a background in graphic design, but discovered programming and decided that that suited me better. These days, I'm a <span>front end web developer</span> specialising in <span>React,</span> with an interest in visual communication.

I love programming, because I love to <span>learn,</span> and I love to <span>solve problems.</span> Programming is logical _and_ creative, and it's much more than just code. There's so much to learn, and so many different ways to solve the same problem. Code is as flexible a tool as I need it to be, and it is this flexibility that the clients I have worked for in the past value so much.

My love for learning also translates into a fondness for <span>teaching.</span> In the past, I have volunteered as a mentor for beginners in a day-long crash course, and enjoyed every second of it.

When I'm not busy with client projects, I spend my time reading, and when I'm not doing that, I enjoy writing, drawing, and cooking. Currently, I'm looking for full-time employment.
